I am a fourth-year undergraduate student at UW-Madison pursuing a double major in Computer Science and Data Science. My ultimate goal in studying CS and working in the tech field has always been to make a positive impact. With the rapid expansion of AI and Large Language Models (LLMs), I believe now is a critical and perfect time to make meaningful contributions to the field.

At the moment, my interests in ML involve the following:

1. Building Trustworthy ML Systems by improving model fairness, robustness, and interpretability. Safety is important for deployment!
2. LLMs for scientific research: What can Transformers learn during In Context Learning?
3. Researching more efficient alternatives to Transformer architectures.
