I am a first year Ph.D. student at UW-Madison, where I work with Prof Grioris Chrysos on trustworthy machine learning. 

At the moment, my interests in ML involve the following:

1. Building Trustworthy ML Systems by improving model fairness, robustness, and interpretability. Safety is important for deployment!
2. LLMs for scientific research: how can we mitigate hallucination?
